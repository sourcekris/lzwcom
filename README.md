### LZWCOM - FILE COMPRESSOR UTILITY

First published in 1985, this source code is for version 1 of
the tool, the second release. This tool uses LZW compression.

This code is very slightly modified so it builds in GCC on
Linux in 2022.

See lzw.doc for original authors documentation.

#### Version 2.0

Code for the later 2.0 version is include but this code does
not build as it is missing the CRC functions. These might be
common
[CRC-16/ARC](http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/CRC-16#CRC-16.2FARC)
algorithms though so it might still be possible to substitute 
suitable code from elsewhere to get these to build.
